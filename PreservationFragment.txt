            <p>data on the Web is essentially about the description of entities
              identified by a unique, Web-based, identifier (a URI). Once the
              data is dumped and sent to an institute specialised in digital
              preservation the link with the Web is broken (de-referencing) but
              the role of the URI as a unique identifier still remains. In order
              to increase the usability of preserved dataset dumps it is
              relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers.</p>

            <p>URI dereferencing is a primary interface to data on the Web. Linking
              preserved datasets with the original URI inform the data consumer of
              the status of these resources. </p>
            <p>During its life cycle a dataset may undergo several
              modifications. Although URIs assigned to things are not expected
              to change, the description of these resource will evolve over
              time. <!--There are also some new IRIs that will be put into use, some
              other that will become deprecated, and some that will get deleted. -->
              During this evolution, several snapshots could be made available
              for preservation. An example of this is <a href="http://debpedia.org">DBpedia</a> which has undergone
              several releases since its first publication and always uses the
              same URI for its resources. Every resource is de-referenced to the
              most up to date description available for it along with a link to
              preserved descriptions using the Memento protocol [[RFC7809]]

            <p>There is a variety of HTTP status codes that could be put into use
              to relate the URI with its preserved description. In particular,
              200, 410 and 303 can be used for different scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>200 =&gt; there is a new description which contains pointers
                to archived description</li>
<!--              <li>404 =&gt; the resource just died, the URI consumer has to go
                find an archive to look for it</li> -->
              <li>410 =&gt; the resource is no longer available but it has been removed under a controlled process cf. 404 which simply states that something is not available.</li>
              <li>303 =&gt; the resource identified by this URI is no longer served here
                but there is a preserved description at a different location.</li>
<!--              <li>209 =&gt; this resource does not exist any more but we have
                some information about it. The description could include a list

                different times.</li> -->
            </ul>
